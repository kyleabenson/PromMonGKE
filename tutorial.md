# Prometheus Monitoring for Google Kubernetes Engine

## Introduction

In this hands-on tutorial, you'll setup a simple GKE cluster, then deploy Managed Service for Prometheus to ingest metrics from a simple application

### Pre-requisites
Select the project you'd like to work in:
<walkthrough-project-setup></walkthrough-project-setup>

Then, you'll deploy a standard GKE cluster, which will prompt you to authorize and enable the GKE API.

```
gcloud container clusters create gmp-cluster --num-nodes=1
```

Next you'll authenticate to the cluster
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials gmp-cluster
```

Last you'll want to make sure the Monitoring API is enabled. This should be done automatically when creating the GKE cluster but you can make certain:

```
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com
```

On to the next section to start deployment!

### Deploy the Prometheus service
In this example, we'll walk through using the Managed Collection provided by Google Cloud to scrape metrics
 
https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/setup-managed

We'll first create a namespace to do the work in:

```
kubectl create ns gmp-test
```
Then we'll deploy the custom resource defintion and operator to deploy Prometheus within that GKE cluster

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/prometheus-engine/v0.1.1/examples/setup.yaml
```

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/prometheus-engine/v0.1.1/examples/operator.yaml
```


### Deploy the application

Next we'll deploy a really simple application which emits metrics at the /metrics endpoint:

```
kubectl -n gmp-test apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyleabenson/flask_telemetry/master/gmp_prom_setup/flask_deployment.yaml
```

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyleabenson/flask_telemetry/master/gmp_prom_setup/flask_service.yaml
```
Then we'll tell Prometheus where to begin scraping the metrics from by applying the PodMonitoring file:

```
kubectl -n gmp-test apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyleabenson/flask_telemetry/master/gmp_prom_setup/prom_deploy.yaml
```

Before we finish up here, we'll generate some load on the application with a really simple interaction with the app:

```
timeout 120 bash -c -- 'while true; do curl $(kubectl get services -n gmp-test -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'); sleep $((RANDOM % 4)) ; done'
```

This will run for 2 minutes, and when done, we can create a visualization of what this looks like!

### Observing the app via metrics

In this last section, we'll quickly use `gcloud` to deploy a custom monitoring dashboard that shows the metrics from this application in a line chart:

```
gcloud monitoring dashboards create --config='''
